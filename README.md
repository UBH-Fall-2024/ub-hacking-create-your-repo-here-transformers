### Introduction

This application captures audio input, transcribes it to text, and processes the text using an integrated large language model (LLM). The application is designed to be scalable and containerized, leveraging Docker to manage dependencies and streamline deployment.

### Features

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text in real-time.
- **Large Language Model Integration**: Hosts an LLM for text processing, accessible via a Docker container.
- **Fails Index Logging**: Tracks failed or unrecognized transcription attempts for error analysis.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-service.git
   cd speech-to-text-service
2. Set up the Docker environment:

docker build -t speech-to-text-service .
Start the Docker container:
docker run -p 8000:8000 speech-to-text-service
Install dependencies for local Python development (optional):
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Docker Configuration

The Dockerfile manages the setup for the LLM. It installs dependencies, exposes necessary ports, and runs the service on startup.

Environment Variables

MODEL_PATH: Path to the Vosk model for speech-to-text recognition.
LOG_PATH: Directory path for logging the fails index.
Update these in a .env file or within Docker environment variables as needed.

Usage
Start the Service: Run the Docker container as described in the Installation section.
Make Requests: Access the service API at http://localhost:8000 for speech-to-text transcription.
Example
Example transcription request and response:

curl -X POST -F 'audio_file=@path/to/audio.wav' http://localhost:8000/transcribe
Response:

{
    "transcription": "This is a sample transcription."
}
Fails Index
The application maintains a fails index for unrecognized transcriptions or errors in processing. These entries are logged to a file for further analysis.
